#Contributing

Contributions to Lexeme are very welcome. If you have an idea for a major feature, please open an issue so we can discuss its implementation. For minor bugfixes, just open a pull request!

When making changes in your own fork, please create a new branch, so that it's easier for me to test and merge!
