#Lexeme
Lexeme is a command-line constructed language word database, generation, and declension program. Contributions are very welcome: see (CONTRIBUTING.md).

##Features
+ Words are saved in a searchable, filterable SQLite database.
+ Generate words according to a basic syllable rule, or use advanced rules to specify unique patterns for different parts of speech. Phonotactics rules can be further applied during generation.
+ Tag words with custom fields, for example gender or vowel harmony type, and filter the database according to any field.
+ Batch generate words from file.
+ Set declension rules and autodecline or conjugate words to different tenses, aspects, cases, or any other desired form.
+ Automatically convert words to their phonetic representation through specified rules.
+ Export database to a csv file compatible with [Polyglot](https://github.com/DraqueT/PolyGlot) or spreadsheet software.
+ Easily configurable through a file.
