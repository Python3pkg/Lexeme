====

====
The list command lists words in the database, and can be filtered by specific field.

  Enter list type (all/field): field
  Enter desired field (form/gender/modality/dissonance): form
  Enter option to list (adjective/adverb/noun/verb): noun

  English     Conlang         Form
  ----------  --------------  ------
  test        ān              noun
  weekend     hőnyőnhān       noun

  muffin      pēto            noun
  t-shirt     kōnbőnkőn       noun
  pig         yokotun         noun

The command autodetects fields and options present within the database.
====

SEARCH
====
The search command can search by English or conlang word.

  search term: test

  English    Conlang    Form
  ---------  ---------  ------
  test       kōndőn     noun
          /kɔːndøn/
          [kɔːndøn]
====

DECLINE
====
The decline command puts a specified word into a conjugated or declined form as specified by rules in the configuration file.

  Enter word (in conlang) to decline: pōyōmő
  Select declension:
  (1) prog
  (2) inch
  Enter selection: 1

  Conlang        English    Form    Gender    Modality    Dissonance
  -------------  ---------  ------  --------  ----------  ------------
  pōyōmőba       to drawl   verb
  /pɔːjɔːmøba/
  [pʷɔːjɔːmøba]

Rules are specified in the configuration file using regular expressions, as seen in the following example:

  [DECLENSION]
  PROG = $->ba
  INCH = $->tse

Here, the INCH (inchoative) rule changes the end of the line to 'tse', in effect adding a suffix. Through specifying these rules using regular expressions, suffixes, prefixes, and infixes can all be easily handled by Lexeme.
====

IMPORT
====
The import command imports a csv file into the current database. The csv format should look something like this:

  id,word,english,form,gender,modality,dissonance
  1,en,dog,noun,,,
  7,hőnyőnhān,weekend,noun,,,
  9,yőntsēnsen,eye,noun,,,
  12,tākēsapa,poor,adjective,,,
  13,behatā,rich,adjective,male,,
  14,yanpenkān,headphones,noun,,,
  15,dadepēpe,to run,verb,,fast,

Custom fields like gender will be autodetected by Lexeme and included in the database. The id field is not necessary but will be present if the csv file has previously been exported from Lexeme. The format of the file to import can be somewhat flexible, and Lexeme should autodetect the delimiter character.
====

BATCH
====
The batch command allows a text file of English words to be used in generation. The command will step through each word in the file, structured like so:

  lemonade
  to hit
  soft
  quickly

On each word, it will run generation with the word as the English base.
====

STATISTICS
====
The statistics command simply outputs some statistics about the word database.
====

QUIT
====
Fairly self-explanatory.
====

EXPORT
====
The export command simply exports the current database to a specified file in csv format. This can then be imported into spreadsheet programs like Libreoffice Calc or programs such as Polyglot.
====

EXPORTWORDS
====
The export command exports the current database into a text file, with strings formatted including to a template specified in the configuration file. For example, the following setting substitutes the fields of word, english, and form:
	
  [EXPORT]
  Format = {{word}} ({{form}}) - {{english}}

This produces a text file in this format:
  
  tākēsapa (adjective) - poor
  behatā (adjective) - rich
  yanpenkān (noun) - headphones

All fields, including custom fields, can be specified in templates through the use of the {{field}} syntax. If a word does not have the specified field, that part of the output will be blank.
